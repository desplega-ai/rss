# Resend RSS Feed Generator

> **The Origin Story**: My friend [M](https://dziban.net/) asked to be removed from our newsletter. But instead of just hitting unsubscribe like a normal person, he said: *"Just give me an RSS feed"*. So here we are. This is what friendship looks like in 2025. 😅

A Next.js API that converts [Resend](https://resend.com) newsletter broadcasts into an RSS feed with full HTML content. Built for [desplega.ai](https://desplega.ai) to give power users RSS access to our newsletter without maintaining a separate distribution system.

## 🎉 Update: Resend API Improvement

After posting about [the limitations we encountered](INITIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md) on Hacker News, [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/) (CEO of Resend) reached out and **updated the Broadcast API to include HTML content directly**. This allowed us to simplify the implementation by ~44% (262 → 146 lines) and make it much faster. Thanks Resend team! 🙏

[Read about the initial implementation](INITIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md) to see how user feedback can drive API improvements.

## Why This Exists

At [desplega.ai](https://desplega.ai), we send newsletters via Resend. Some folks (looking at you, M) prefer RSS feeds over email. Instead of maintaining two separate systems, this API:

- ✅ Syncs broadcasts from Resend daily via cron
- ✅ Caches everything in Vercel Blob for fast access
- ✅ Serves a standard RSS feed with full HTML content
- ✅ Provides individual broadcast URLs for web viewing

Perfect for teams using Resend who want to offer RSS without the hassle.

## Features

- **Daily Auto-Sync**: Cron job fetches new broadcasts from Resend every day
- **Simple & Fast**: Direct HTML from Broadcast API (~14s sync time)
- **Full HTML Content**: RSS feed includes complete email HTML (not just text)
- **Individual Broadcast URLs**: Each email is viewable at `/api/broadcast/{id}`
- **Smart Caching**: Uses Vercel Blob for fast RSS generation (no API calls)
- **Rate-Limited**: Respects Resend's 2 calls/second limit
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript

## How It Works

RSS_FEED_DESCRIPTION="RSS feed of newsletter broadcasts"
```

**Environment Variable Details:**

| Variable | Required | Description | Default |

### Local Development

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Trigger cron job manually (in another terminal)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"

# View RSS feed
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rss
# or open in browser
open http://localhost:3000/api/rss
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository

3. **Add Environment Variables**

   In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables:

   **Required:**
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key
   - `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` - Target audience ID
   - `CRON_SECRET` - Random secret for cron authentication
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Auto-generated when you enable Vercel Blob

   **Optional (RSS Customization):**
   - `RSS_FEED_TITLE` - Custom feed title (default: "Newsletter Feed")
   - `RSS_FEED_DESCRIPTION` - Custom feed description (default: "RSS feed of newsletter broadcasts")

4. **Enable Vercel Blob**
   - Go to Storage tab → Create Blob Store
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` will be automatically set

5. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy on push
   - Cron runs daily at midnight UTC (configured in `vercel.json`)

6. **First Run** (Manual Trigger)
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
   ```

7. **Access Your RSS Feed**
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/rss
   ```

## API Endpoints

### `GET /api/rss`

Returns RSS XML feed with all broadcasts.

**Response:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Newsletter Feed</title>
    <description>RSS feed of newsletter broadcasts</description>
    <item>
      <title>Newsletter Subject</title>
      <link>https://your-app.vercel.app/api/broadcast/{id}</link>
      <guid>https://your-app.vercel.app/api/broadcast/{id}</guid>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 18:54:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[Full HTML content here]]></description>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

### `GET /api/cron`

Syncs data from Resend. Protected by `Authorization` header.

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {CRON_SECRET}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "audiences": 1,
  "broadcasts": 5
}
```

**Performance:**
- Typical sync: ~14 seconds (fetches broadcast details with HTML)

### `GET /api/broadcast/[id]`

Renders individual broadcast as HTML page.

**Example:**
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/broadcast/fa8f0216-3d02-4543-ad86-5e92e3c27124
```

## History: From Limitation to Feature

### The Original Problem

Initially, Resend's broadcast API didn't return email content (HTML/text). We had to build a complex workaround involving email fetching and matching. This worked but was slow (~4 minutes) and complex (~262 lines of code).

[Read about the initial implementation →](INITIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### The Resolution

After we shared our experience on Hacker News, the Resend team (shoutout to Zeno!) **updated the Broadcast API to include HTML content directly**. This is a perfect example of how developer feedback can drive API improvements.

**Impact:**
- 🚀 44% code reduction (262 → 146 lines)
- ⚡ 94% faster (~14s vs 4 min)
- 🎯 No complex matching logic needed
- 🧹 Simpler architecture

### Current Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: Resend allows 2 API calls/second, so large broadcast lists may take time
- **Vercel Blob**: Free tier has storage limits; consider S3 for larger deployments (see [Migration to S3](#migration-to-s3))

## Future Improvements

### Migration to S3

Currently using Vercel Blob for storage. If you outgrow it or want more control:

**Benefits of S3:**
- Lower cost at scale
- More control over data
- Works outside Vercel ecosystem
- Better for multi-region deployments

**Migration Path:**

1. Install AWS SDK:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-s3
   ```

2. Replace `@vercel/blob` imports with S3 client

3. Update storage functions:
   ```typescript
   import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand, GetObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';

   const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });

   // Instead of: put(key, data, options)
   await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand({
     Bucket: 'your-bucket',
     Key: key,
     Body: data,
   }));
   ```

4. Update environment variables to use S3 credentials

The code structure is designed to make this swap easy - all storage operations are isolated in the cron route.

## Development Notes

### Rate Limiting

Resend allows **2 API calls per second**. The cron job adds 500ms delays between calls to respect this limit.

### Blob Storage Keys

```
rss_audiences                # All audiences
rss_broadcasts               # All broadcasts for target audience
rss_broadcast_{id}_info      # Full broadcast with HTML
rss_broadcast_{id}_info_md   # Markdown version (for future use)
rss_audience_{id}            # Individual audience (for reference)
```

### Dynamic RSS Rendering

The RSS endpoint uses `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to ensure it always fetches fresh data from Vercel Blob instead of serving a cached static version.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - API routes
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vercel Blob** - Storage
- **Vercel Cron** - Scheduled jobs
- **Turndown** - HTML to Markdown (stored but not used in RSS)
- **Resend API** - Source data
